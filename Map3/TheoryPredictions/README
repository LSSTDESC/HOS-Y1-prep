Author: Laila Linke, laila.linke@uibk.ac.at

They were computed using the threepoint code (Heydenreich et al, 2023,;Linke et al. 2022)

This model is based on the bihalofit-Bispectrum, so accuracies of ~10% are expected.

The cosmology used was
h 0.71
sigma_8 0.801
Omega_b 0.0448
n_s 0.963
w -1
Omega_m 0.2648

The files are ASCII with the format

# This folder contains predictions obtained from the cosmoSIS package, 
# assuming the cosmology of the OuterRim simulations and the Stage-IV lensing survey 
# n(z) of Harnois-Deraps+2021. See the file values.txt for details.
#
# The files bin_<i>_<j>.txt contain the lensing 2-point correlation functions xip and xim computed between tomographuc bins <i> and <j>.
# The angular separations are in radians, provided in the file theta.txt
